# Decision Tree Classifier (Gini Impurity)

This repository contains a complete, end-to-end implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **Gini Impurity** with `scikit-learn`.

The project demonstrates:
- Dataset loading
- Model training
- Model evaluation (Accuracy & Confusion Matrix)
- Prediction on new/unseen data

The focus is on **practical understanding**, not just theory.
